# Unstop Assessment Task - Ticket Booking Website

This repository contains a website with basic functionality of booking train ticket.


## Tech Stack

**Client:** React, HTML, JavaScript, CSS.  

**Server:** Node, Express, JSON.


## Functionality

- Select number of tickets you want to book.
- Reset if you want to empty all seats (Just for testing).
- Algorithm will try to allocate tickets in a single row if possible, otherwise it will give tickets of most nearby seats.


## Things to Note

- Hosted version might work slower.
- Local JSON files are used as database.
- I have assumed that no userdata is necessary here and hence didn't store any data related to User.
## Deployment

- I have deployed this website on Render, here is the link of the same: https://train-booking-9rs4.onrender.com/

- APIs are also deplyed on the same platform.
